## 0.1.0 - 2016-12-08

Initial release.

Based on the 0.4.0 version of [mtymek/expressive-config-manager](https://github.com/mtymek/expressive-config-manager),
this version renames the namespace from `Zend\Expressive\ConfigManager` to
`Zend\ConfigAggregator`, and renames the `ConfigManager` class to
`ConfigAggregator`. All other functionality remains the same.
